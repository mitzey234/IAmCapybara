# IAmCapybara

Yeah this is a capybara. It's a gem that helps you terrorize your players for fun (or content) by hijacking the SCP 956 instance.

This plugin is playerID restricted which means if you want to use it you need to add your steamID / discordID to the config file that is generated. Only players in this list can use this command.

# Commands
All commands are prefixed with `iam` and can only be accessed using the RA console.

You can however bind them to a key in your client by prefixing the command with `/` and cmdbind.

- `iam capybara` - Spawns a capybara at your position. It will follow your position and also rotate to face the same rotation your player camera is facing. It will despawn if you die but you can also use this command to despawn it
- `iam flying` - Sets the capybara to fly mode. This doesn't really do much but it makes it move up and down as if flying
- `iam fake` - Preforms the attack animation of the SCP 956 except without killing anyone. Its a great method of communication :P
- `iam attack` - Preforms the attack animation of the SCP 956 and kills the closest player to your position. This is a great way to get rid of annoying players :)
- `iam spin [speed]` - Makes the capybara SPINâ„¢ but you should not exceed numbers greater than 50, otherwise the animation will not look right. The speed is optional and defaults to 10
- `iam perspective` - Toggles the perspective of the capybara. This will make it so your camera perspective is around the same height of the coconut dog

# Maintenance

I will not maintain this repo since this plugin is a one-off feature based on a SCP that won't be in the game for long. Don't expect much support from me on this plugin, if its broken then its broken. I will not be fixing it. Feel free to fork and fix it yourself if you want to use it.
